e:T45d,Although initially tasked with processing 100,000 files, their workflow using the OSPool has since surged beyond 400,000 files—an accomplishment that would have been financially daunting in a traditional cloud environment. Wall emphasized that “what OSPool has allowed us to do is fail, which is really, really good. Before [using the] OSPool, we started by processing a couple of cruises with a very small number of files in the cloud to be cost-effective; we didn’t want to make costly mistakes. Being able to use OSPool to iterate and strengthen our process, allowed us to then scale to the volume of data and number of files that we need to process. I don't know where we would be without OSPool but it would've cost us tens of thousands of dollars. We didn't have to sacrifice for a lesser workflow, one that we didn't improve upon because it would have cost us more money. I'm really excited about where OSPool has allowed us to go, and now we can take that next step to say ‘okay, we have our foundation, which is our data and a great format, and we can build our models and additional workflows.’”2:["$","$La",null,{"maxWidth":"md","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"pt":6,"children":[["$","$Lb",null,{"textAlign":"center","pb":2,"children":[["$","$Lb",null,{"pb":6,"children":["$","$Lc",null,{"variant":"h3","children":["$","$Ld",null,{"children":"NOAA funded marine scientist uses OSPool access to high throughput computing to explode her boundaries of research"}]}]}],["$","$Lb",null,{"height":"1rem","borderRadius":"10px","bgcolor":"primary.main"}],["$","$Lb",null,{"pt":1,"display":"flex","justifyContent":"space-between","children":[["$","$Lc",null,{"variant":"h5","children":"Cristina Encarnacion"}],["$","$Lc",null,{"variant":"h5","children":"6/13/2024"}]]}]]}],[["$","$Lc",null,{"variant":"body1","children":"Dr. Carrie Wall, a research scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, shares how access to OSPool resources has allowed her team to expand the scope of their research and to fail, unconstrained by the cost of computing in the cloud and the associated restraints that places on research."}],"\n",["$","figure","figure-0",{"children":["\n",["$","img",null,{"style":{"maxWidth":"100%","height":"auto"},"src":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/noaa-banner.png","alt":"Water column sonar data collected on the NOAA Okeanos Explorer in the North Atlantic Ocean: One of NOAA’s research cruises."}],"\n",["$","figcaption","figcaption-0",{"children":"Water column sonar data collected on the NOAA Okeanos Explorer in the North Atlantic Ocean: One of NOAA’s research cruises."}],"\n"]}],"\n",["$","$Lc",null,{"variant":"body1","children":["A marine scientist faced the daunting challenge of processing sonar data from 65 research cruises spanning 20 years, totaling over 100,000 files.
